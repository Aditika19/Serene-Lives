                    <p>The sessions have helped me to let go of a bag of emotions I was carrying around which were a burden to me and hindering me from returning to work. I am now very calm and relaxed in the workplace, which is  a massive improvement. If a matter needs addressed I raise it with management in writing and I also take small breaks when required.  (  I had 6 sessions of mindfulness based therapy) re TREATMENT SPACE ( seen in Moniaive): I found the treatment rooms in Moniaive to be a very calm and peaceful space to have therapy. Lovely setting and I also enjoyed the drive across the countryside there.  "  (rated treatment as 10 very helpful and self as 10= very much improved).</p>

                        <p>"I'm so thankful for the very helpful treatment I received. Before therapy I was extremely negative with myself, highly self-critical . I constantly worried about others not liking me and getting rejected, leading me to avoid many  activities or ending up in tears going over what I had done wrong thereafter. I am now  much more confident in myself and have useful techniques that help me  be more kind with myself when the old self-doubt comes up, which it now rarely does. Karina has really helped me  working through my past issues understanding what I have been through is not my fault. seeing the unhelpful patterns I used to get into and teaching me many useful coping strategies. I can now mostly enjoy life , am in my first long term relationship,  that feels really positive and stable and have also started a sucessful new career. I am very proud of how far I have come.  I attended both  initially face to face and later online therapy and found  both equally beneficial."</p>

                    <p>" I found it helpful and definately have improved. The coping mechanisms learned  have helped me a great deal. It is easier for me now to move on from "static" negative thoughts and have a more positive outlook in life..."
